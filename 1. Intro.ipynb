    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "PowerShell is a command shell, meaning you can open a 'shell' (a historical term for any program that allows human interaction with the OS) and send instructions to, or retrieve information from, the operating system in the form of PowerShell commands. It is also a scripting language, meaning these commands can be written into files and ran, encapsulated together as a rudiementary program (although, beyond basic scripts PowerShell is in fact a full programming language). \n",
    "\n",
    "An important conceptual difference between PowerShell and older unix-style command shells, which worked solely on text streams, is that PowerShell is _object_-first; the input and output of every command is an **object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like objects in object-orientated programming, PowerShells objects have _members_, which are the data stored in the object and the functionality that can be used on the object. PowerShell extends this by providing the means to pass objects to commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "The below command `Get-Process` retrieves information about the process named 'code' (vscode) and constructs a PowerShell style object with that information. Passing it via the _pipeline_ (the '|' operator) to another command, `Get-Member`, it is possible to see the various member functions that can be used on this object, such as to kill the process, as well as the data members that store information about the process, such as the number of threads."
