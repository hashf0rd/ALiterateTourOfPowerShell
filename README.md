# A Literate Tour of PowerShell
A literate programming tour of the major features of the PowerShell programming language and envrionment, using VSCode + Polyglot Notebooks. These notebooks are meant to present a shallow but broad treatement of PowerShell, and it is expected that the reader will do additional exploration of PowerShell themselves.

# Requirements
These notebooks perform actions that query the local system in order to demonstrate various PowerShell features. As such they require viewing locally (i.e not using a distributed system like binder) via VSCode and the [Polyglot Notebook extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode), or alternatively a local Juypter server and the [.Net interactive kernel](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive).
