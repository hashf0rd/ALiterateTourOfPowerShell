    "## Writing a Binary Cmdlet\n",
    "As described previously, cmdlets are light weight commands that are part of the PowerShell environment. Cmdlets can be written as .NET classes in C#, or as PowerShell scripts.\n",
    "Script based cmdlets are explained in the [Functions](6.%20Functions.ipynb) notebook. This notebook describes how to write a rudimentary binary cmdlet using C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the PowerShell code below, a the .NET class is written that describes a new cmdlet called `Get-CodePids`. The cmdlet gets the PIDs of all running VSCode processes. The class is stored in a variable called `$source`, and then the `Add-Type` cmdlet is called to compile `$source` into a temporary executable file known in .NET as an _assembly_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Import-Module` cmdlet can take in an assembly and load it into the current PowerShell runtime as a _module_, making the commands contained in the assembly available for use. Calling the `Get-CodePids` cmdlet should print the aforementioned PIDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the C# code below is explained with comments, however a full explanation is outside the scope of this notebook."
